# Deployment

This section  shows you how to deploy an instance of the rightwatching shiny app. The app
* gathers statistics relevant to far-right and racist violence
* obtains data of far-right and racist violence, either via an API or scraping
* visualises incidents together with relevant statistics

## Container I: Get data

The first docker container contains all files that need to be fetched for a smooth shiny app experience. This container is not exposed to the user, it only saves data weekly in Rdata files. 

General process: 
* Building the docker image, based rocker images
* run the container with cronjob, mounting two volumes: 
  * volume to store the data, /data
  * volume where R scripts live

### Build Image

This dockerfile builds the image.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
FROM rocker/geospatial:4.0.3

MAINTAINER Rightwatching "info@rightwatching.org"

WORKDIR /srv/prepare/

# install dependencies of the app
RUN R -e "install.packages(c('jsonlite', 'osmdata', 'htmltools', 'rvest', 'xml2', 'httr', 'tryCatchLog', 'futile.logger', 'hrbrthemes', 'viridis', 'lubridate', 'ggspatial', 'quanteda', 'ggrepel', 'wordcloud', 'librarian', 'tm'), repos='https://cloud.r-project.org/')"

RUN R -e "librarian::shelf(CorrelAid/datenguideR, dieghernan/giscoR)"

#for dates, give proper locale
RUN locale-gen de_DE.UTF-8 && \
    update-locale

#run scripts with nonroot users. rstudio user already set up in rocker images
RUN chown -R rstudio:rstudio /srv/

#copy prep scripts to container workdir
#COPY ./ ./

USER rstudio

#define what to run when container starts: the full prepare script is launched
CMD Rscript --verbose /srv/prepare/prepare.R
```

### Run Container

We mount two volumes into the container: one to store and retrieve data, one with all scripts. 

Code to adjust before running: 

* if you are using a public instance of nominatim you must change the api url in def_geocode and you can omit the `--net geocode` flag. This will take considerably longer as your script should sleep for 1 second when calling public nominatim instances.
* the script getexternaldata.R uses two Germany-specific sources: datenguideR and a dataset of historic election results. All other datasets are from Eurostat via GiscoR and should be reproducible to other EU countries
* to get the German historic election dataset you must register and download it from here


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd this/repo/on/your/host
docker run --rm --net geocode -v ./repo/data:/srv/data -v ./prepare:/srv/prepare shiny-report-prepare
```




## Container II: Visualise Data

All code for this task resides [in this repository](https://github.com/chris-toph-t/rightwatching-shiny-app). The goal is to create a shiny app that consumes data from the previous step and visualizes it. 

### Build Image

* Build the image based on [the dockerfile](https://github.com/chris-toph-t/rightwatching-shiny-app/blob/main/Dockerfile) with `docker build . -t rightwatching`
* ensure that in the /data folder you have the Rdata files from the previous step.
* In a production environment you may want to launch the app with shinyproxy. Proceed to the next step. 


### Run Container

* You can launch the app by manually running the docker container. It will listen on port 3838. 

## Container III: User login

In the tools direcotry of the same repository you can find the shinyproxy Dockerfile and Config.yml file. These are needed for shinyproxy to launch the app.  

## Container IV: SSL Encryption
