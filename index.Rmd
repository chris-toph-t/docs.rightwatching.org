# Introduction {#intro}

Rightwatching is a project to help counselling organisations and watchdogs to monitor far-right and racist violence. The project was funded from the German Minstry of Education and Research through the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de). 

This book is for three purposes: 

* Head to chapter \@ref(usage) if you're a user of [our app](https://app.rightwatching.org). 
* You can use the chapter \@ref(deployment) to run your own instance of a dockerized shiny app obtaining and analysing far-right violence. This requires some technical background and a server. 
* You can use the chapter \@ref(wrangle) for R scripts and snippets to create charts and maps out of your own incident data. If you have a data file with your own incidents, head there. You should know a bit about the R programming language. 

## How to use this book

This book is mainly written for people who deal with - often violent - incidents. Read more about our concept of incident data here \@ref(incidents)

Throughout this book we use the term chronicle for a table of incidents. We mainly focus on generating publication-oriented static charts and maps. 

* The chapter \@ref(wrangle) will guide how to get your incidents into such a table. 
* The chapter \@ref(visualize) will show you some basic charts and maps to generate out of your incident data. 
* The chapter \@ref(contextualize) has some recipes for external data (i.e. not your own incident data) to enhance your incident data. 
* The chapter \@ref(verify) provides some quick methods to check your incidents against 

## Does it need such a book? 

We believe incident monitoring is critical in many areas. Many chapters of this book have been inspired from work in armed conflict and monitoring of racist and right-wing violence. Any sort of incidents with an impact on humans could benefit from the recipes in this book.
