This book is for two purposes: 

* You can use the deployment section to run your own instance of a dockerized shiny app scraping and analysing far-right violence. 
* You can use the incident analysis section to get R scripts and snippets to create charts and maps out of your own incident data. If you have a data file with your own incidents, head there.
