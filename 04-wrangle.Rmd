# Wrangle

This chapter shows how to get incident data into a tidy data format: each row is one incident (observation), each column is one attribute of the incident (variable). Incident data can be a tricky to get tidy. 


## Import incidents

### Regular Import

* with readr

### Scraping


## Clean incidents

### Extract dates

#### Your dates are in a mixed format

#### Summarising dates

* lubridate::month()

### Source classification

* keeping a classification file or logic. Anything containing Zeitung becomes news. 
* exploding urls and keep only tlds. 

### Geocoding

* Prepare placestring
* use udpipe to annotate text and get location names (not really possible, udpipe gives only proper nouns)
* Geocoding function for nominatim or self-hosted instance

## Summarise Incidents

* just summarise and groupy_by
